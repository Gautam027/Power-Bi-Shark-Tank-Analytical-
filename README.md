# Power-Bi-Shark-Tank-Analytical-
# "Shark Tank" is a popular TV show where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of investors (the "sharks") in hopes of securing investment for a stake in their company. The show provides insights into the world of startups, investments, and entrepreneurship. Here are some key aspects of "Shark Tank" analysis".

# Pitch Quality: A successful pitch involves a clear and compelling presentation. Entrepreneurs need to effectively communicate their idea, market potential, unique selling proposition, and financials within a few minutes.

# Business Viability: Sharks assess the viability and scalability of the business. They analyze the market demand, competitive landscape, potential for growth, and the entrepreneur's ability to execute their plan.

# Valuation: Entrepreneurs must justify their company's valuation. Sharks often negotiate for a stake in the business in exchange for their investment, and disagreements over valuation can make or break a deal.

# Negotiation Skills: Negotiation is a significant aspect. Entrepreneurs must navigate offers from the sharks, considering not only the investment amount but also the expertise and connections the sharks bring.

# Entrepreneurial Spirit: Sharks look for passionate, driven, and coachable entrepreneurs who are committed to their business and willing to adapt to feedback and guidance.

# Post-Deal Success: Securing a deal on the show doesn't guarantee success. Many factors, including execution, market changes, and the involvement of the sharks, influence the long-term success of the businesses.
